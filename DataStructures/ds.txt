Memory

Bit: Short for binary digit, a bit is afundamental unit of information in CS that represents a state with one of two values, typically 0 and 1
  Any data stored in a computer is, at the most basic level, represented in bits. 
Byte
A group of eight bits. For example, 01101000 is a byte.
<p>
  A single byte can represent up to <b>256</b> data values (<b>2<sup>8</sup></b>).
</p>
<p>
  Since a <b>binary number</b> is a number expressed with only two symbols, like
  <b>0</b> and <b>1</b>, a byte can effectively represent all of the numbers
  between 0 and 255, inclusive, in binary format.
</p>
<p>
  The following bytes represent the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in binary format.
</p>
<pre>1: 00000001
2: 00000010
3: 00000011
4: 00000100
</pre>

<p>
  An integer represented by a fixed amount of <b>bits</b>. For example, a
  <b>32-bit integer</b> is an integer represented by 32 bits (4 bytes), and a
  <b>64-bit integer</b> is an integer represented by 64 bits (8 bytes).
</p>
<p>
  The following is the 32-bit representation of the number 1, with clearly
  separated bytes:
</p>
<pre>00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001
</pre>
<p>
  The following is the 64-bit representation of the number 10, with clearly
  separated bytes:
</p>
<pre>00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001010
</pre>
<p>
  Regardless of how large an integer is, its fixed-width-integer representation
  is, by definition, made up of a constant number of bits.
</p>
<p>
  It follows that, regardless of how large an integer is, an operation performed
  on its fixed-width-integer representation consists of a constant number of bit
  manipulations, since the integer is made up of a fixed number of bits.

<p>
  Broadly speaking, memory is the foundational layer of computing, where all
  data is stored.
</p>
<p>
  In the context of coding interviews, it's important to note the following
  points:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data stored in memory is stored in bytes and, by extension, bits.</li>
  <li>
    Bytes in memory can "point" to other bytes in memory, so as to store
    references to other data.
  </li>
  <li>
    The amount of memory that a machine has is bounded, making it valuable to
    limit how much memory an algorithm takes up.
  </li>
  <li>
    Accessing a byte or a fixed number of bytes (like 4 bytes or 8 bytes in the
    case of <b>32-bit</b> and <b>64-bit integers</b>) is an elementary
    operation, which can be loosely treated as a single unit of operational
    work.

</ul>
